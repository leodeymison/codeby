## About author
My name is Leodeymison, I'm passionate about learning and creating projects. I've been in this world of programming for about four years, i started at 15 and i'm currently 19.

I see that my difference to compete for this vacancy is in addition to knowing frontend technologies like React and Vuejs, I have also worked in a company as a backend developer, using the node language and some tools like GraphQL, Express, Docker and some things I always try to follow, such as S.O.L.I.D, Designer patterns and whenever I have the opportunity,  microservices and DDD. 

I confess that I have a lot to learn, because my study worksheet never ends, I hope to have the opportunity to talk to you, to know more about you and you more about me.
